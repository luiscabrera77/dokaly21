## In the beginning

There were bands with songs, and there were visual artists with... yes, art. For eons the two would produce beautiful work and long to share it with the other party... but there were simply not connected.

---

## What if

We could connect artists? and more importantly, what if allow fans to get involved in deciding what art and images bets represent a song? 

---

## How it works

Each week, we feature a music artist and one of his songs. The fans are able to listen to the music and comment on pictures that match the mood of that song. Those feeling artisitic, can also submit their own art and allow other to comment  browse through many pictures
