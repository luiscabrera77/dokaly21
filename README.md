## In the beginning

There were bands with songs, and there were visual artists with... yes, art. For eons, the two would produce beautiful work, but they were simply not connected.

Also, how many times have you ever picked up an album and thought "This isn't a great look for such awesome music, what were they thinking?" Or worse, how many times you have skipped listening to new music just based on the looks of its cover?

---

## What if

We could connect artists? and more importantly, what if allow fans to get involved in deciding what art and images best represent a song? 

---

## How it works

Each week, we feature a music artist and one of his songs. Fans are able to listen to the music and comment on pictures that match the mood of that song. Those feeling artisitic, can also submit their own art and let users follow them and see all their contributions.
